# HTML, CSS and Javascript Project for begginers

This project's main purpose is to help us students to get comfortable with HTML, CSS and javascript by learning by the means of practice.

## Description

In this little practice project I'm aiming to emulate the format of a travel web page. Focused specifically on advertising Gran Canaria, it is intended for the page to give to registered users the tools to book a trip to the island, as well as offering some info about the places of interest and wonders Gran Canaria.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* It makes use of icons from the FontAwesome library "https://kit.fontawesome.com/eed3c59194.js"

### Installing

* This project is meant for school marking and can be accessed from GitHub by the professor's request.

### Executing program

* This project is an HTML web page designed to be displayed in three different screen types.

For the 'tablet' and 'cell phone' versions, the user menu embedded in the header section of the page remains hidden until the user presses the 'user' icon and can be hid again by pressing the icon again.

The round images below the front picture are meant to be information bubbles that would display information about specific places of the island. But this feature, beyond the 'bubble effect', hasn't been implemented yet.

The search bar, as well as the rss icons on the footer, remain inoperative.

### 16/11/2023 COMMIT CHANGES NEW++ SECOND DELIVERY

With this new commit, part of the second of three deliveries of this HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project for my school assignment, I aimed to address some issues from the previous version of the project. Additionally, I aimed to fulfill the requirements of the second delivery, which involved practicing with the Bootstrap framework, JavaScript validation, and utilizing forms.

I must admit, the result ended up being far less polished than I intended. I followed an idea and stuck with it until the end, only to realize that perhaps my skills at the moment and my understanding of Bootstrap weren't sufficient to fully realize my ambitions.

This ongoing page allows users to explore some aspects of the natural treasures of Gran Canaria. They can also share reviews while reading comments and appreciations left by others.

The form used has been validated to make some fields mandatory and to set a maximum length for each of them.
